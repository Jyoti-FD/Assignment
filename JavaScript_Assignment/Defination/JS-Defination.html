    <h1>JavaScript All Definations</h1>
    <h3> &bigstar;1. What is JavaScript?</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>
        <p>JavaScript is a lightweight programming language commonly used by web developers to add dynamic <br> interactions to web pages, applications, servers, and even games.</p>
    </li>
    <li> <p> It works seamlessly alongside HTML and CSS, complementing CSS in formatting HTML elements while providing <br> user interaction, a capability that CSS alone lacks.</p></li>
    <li><p>It creates elements for improving site visitors’ interaction with web pages, such as dropdown menus, <br> animated br graphics, and dynamic background colors.</p></li>
   </ul>
   <br> <hr> <br>
   <h3> &bigstar;2. What is the use of isNaN function?</h3>
 <p>=> The JavaScript isNaN() Function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or not. It <br> returns true if the value is a NaN else returns false. It is different from the Number.isNaN() Method.</p>
 <br><hr><br>
 <h3> &bigstar;3. What is negative Infinity?</h3>
 <p>=> The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value that is used to represent a value that is the lowest available. <br> This means that no other number is lesser than this value. It can be generated using a self-made function or by an arithmetic operation. </p>
 <br><hr><br>
 <h3>&bigstar; 4. Which company developed JavaScript?
</h3>
<p>=> JavaScript was created at Netscape Communications by Brendan Eich in 1995. </p>
<br><hr><br>
<h3>&bigstar; 5. What are undeclared and undefined variables?</h3>
<p>=> Undefined: It occurs when a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. Undefined is not a keyword.</p>
<p>=> Undeclared: It occurs when we try to access any variable that is not initialized or declared earlier using the var or const keyword.</p>
<br><hr><br>
<h3>&bigstar; 6. Write the code for adding new elements dynamically?</h3>
<br><hr><br>
<h3>&bigstar; 7. What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</h3>
<p>=> ViewState</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maintained at page level only.</li>
    <li>View state can only be visible from a single page and not multiple pages.</li>
    <li>It will retain values in the event of a postback operation occurring.</li>
    <li>Information is stored on the client’s end only.</li>
    <li>used to allow the persistence of page-instance-specific data.</li>
    <li>ViewState values are lost/cleared when new page is loaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>=> SessionState</p>
<ul>
    <li>Maintained at session level.</li>
    <li>Session state value availability is across all pages available in a user session.</li>
    <li>In session state, user data remains in the server. Data is available to user until the browser is closed or there is session expiration.</li>
    <li>Information is stored on the server.</li>
    <li>used for the persistence of user-specific data on the server’s end.</li>
    <li>SessionState can be cleared by programmer or user or in case of timeouts.</li>
</ul>
<br><hr><br>
<h3>&bigstar; 8. What is === operator?</h3>
<p>=> JavaScript Strict Equality Operator is used to compare two operands and return true if both the value and type of operands are the same.</p>
<br><hr><br>
<h3>&bigstar; 9. How can the style/class of an element be changed?</h3>
<br><hr><br>
<h3>&bigstar; 10. How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</h3>
<p>=> There are two ways to do it:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Using JavaScript extensions (runs from JavaScript Editor), or</li>
    <li> Using a web page and ActiveX objects (Internet Explorer only)</li>
</ol>
<br><hr><br>
<h3>&bigstar; 11. What are all the looping structures in JavaScript?</h3>
<p>=> Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.</p>
<p>JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:</p>
<ul>
    <li>for - loops through a block of code a number of times</li>
    <li>for/in - loops through the properties of an object</li>
    <li>for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object</li>
    <li>while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
    <li>do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true</li>
</ul>
<br><hr><br>
<h3>&bigstar; 12. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</h3>
<p>=> To convert a string to an integer parseInt(), Number(), and Unary operator (+) function is used in JavaScript. <br> The parseInt() function returns NaN ( not a number) when the string doesn’t contain number. If a string with a number is sent, then only that <br> number will be returned as the output. This function won't accept spaces. If any particular number with spaces is sent, then the part of <br> the number that presents before space will be returned as the output. </p>
<br><hr><br>
<h3>&bigstar; 13. What is the function of the delete operator?</h3>
<p>=> The delete operator removes a property from an object. If the property's value is an object and there are no <br> more references to the object, the object held by that property is eventually released automatically.</p>
<br><hr><br>
<h3>&bigstar; 14. What are all the types of Pop up boxes available in JavaScript?</h3>
<p>=> In Javascript, popup boxes are used to display the message or notification to the user. There are three types <br> of pop-up boxes in JavaScript namely Alert Box, Confirm Box and Prompt Box.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Alert Box: It is used when a warning message is needed to be produced. When the alert box is displayed to <br> the user, the user needs to press ok and proceed.</li>
    <li>Prompt Box: It is a type of pop up box which is used to get the user input for further use. After entering <br> the required details user have to click ok to proceed next stage else by pressing the cancel button user returns the null value.</li>
    <li>Confirm Box: It is a type of pop-up box that is used to get authorization or permission from the user. <br> The user has to press the ok or cancel button to proceed.</li>
</ol>
<h3>&bigstar; 15. What is the use of Void (0)?</h3>
<p>=> In a programming language, void means return nothing. “javascript: void(0)” is similar to void. <br>

    javascript: void(0) means return undefined as a primitive value. We use this to prevent any negative <br> effects on a webpage when we insert some expression.</p>
    <br><hr><br>
    <h3>&bigstar; 16. How can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>=> : We can use window.location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in Javascript. <br> It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location <br> of the document. We can change the URL of a window by accessing it.</p>
    <br><hr><br>
    <h3>&bigstar; 17. What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>=> disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Content is replaced everywhere</li>
        <li> We cannot use like "appending to innerHTML"</li>
        <li>Even if you use +=like "innerHTML = innerHTML + 'html'" still the old content is replaced by html</li>
        <li>The entire innerHTML content is re-parsed and build into elements, therefore its much slower</li>
        <li>The innerHTML does not provide validation and therefore we can potentially insert valid and broken HTML <br> in the document and break it</li>
    </ul>
