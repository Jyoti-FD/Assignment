    <h2>04.  What do you know about the Bootstrap Grid System?</h2>

    <h2>06. What is a Button Group, and what is the class for a basic Button Group?</h2>

        <h2>07. How can you use Bootstrap to make thumbnails?</h2>
        <p>=>  we need to update the anchor tag to a new div tag, which has . thumbnail as a class.</p>
        <p>In this div tag, we can add any media or text. This div tag is used for a span-based naming
            convention for sizing.</p>
        <br><hr><br>
        <h2>08. In Bootstrap 4, what is flexbox?</h2>
        <p>
          =>  Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox, instead of floats, to handle the layout. The Flexible Box Layout
            Module, makes it easier to design flexible responsive <br> layout structure without using float or
            positioning
