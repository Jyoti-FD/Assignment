    <h2>6* What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? With Example.</h2>
    <p>=> The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element.

        The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.</p>
     <p>for example:- <html>
        <head>
        <style>
        h1.intro {
            color: blue;
        }
        
        p.important {
            color: green;
        }
        </style>
        </head>
        <body>
        
        <h1 class="intro">Header 1</h1>
        <p>A paragraph.</p>
        <p class="important">Note that this is an important paragraph. :)</p>

        elements? With Example.
    </h2>
    <p>=> the difference between Class and ID: A Class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an ID name must only be used by one HTML element within the page.
<br>
        The following is a sample HTML page using the Class name GreekCity. You can copy code from this to try it out yourself. </p>
        <p><!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
            <head>
            <style>

          <h2>10* How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML
            table? With Example.</h2>

            <h2>11* What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</h2>
             <p>
                Block-level Elements</p>
A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.

A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).

Two commonly used block elements are: p tag and div tag.

The p tag element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.

The div tag element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
             </p>
             <p>Inline Element</p>
             <p>
                An inline element does not start on a new line.

An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.

<h2>14* What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?</h2>

           <h2>16* How are active links different from normal links?</h2>
           <p>The default color for normal and active links is blue. Some browsers recognize an active link when the mouse cursor is placed over that link; others recognize active links when the link has the focus. Those that don’t have a mouse cursor over that link is considered a normal link.</p>
<br><hr>
          <h2>17* What are the different tags to separate sections of text?</h2>

        <h2>18* What is SVG?</h2>
        <p>A Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) is a unique type of image format. Unlike other varieties, SVGs don’t rely on unique pixels to make up the images you see. Instead, they use ‘vector’ data. By using SVGs, you get images that can scale up to any resolution, which comes in handy for web design among plenty of other use cases. In this article, we’ll ask the question: What is an SVG file? We’ll then teach you how to use the format.</p>

        <h2>19* What is difference between HTML and XHTML?</h2>
        <p>
         XHTML :-XHTML stands for extensible hypertext markup language which is a connection between HTML (hypertext mark-up language) and XML (extensible markup language) also at most of the places XHTML is considered superior than HTML.

         XHTML is easy to use with other data formats, and it creates more neat code as it is stricter than HTML. Therefore, it is more compatible with most browsers, and it maintains a standard of code that can be used for various devices.
        </p>
        <p>
        HTML :-Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML) is a programming language that shows information and depicts a site page's design.
